# How to Ask Questions

## Learning Goals

- Identify effective methods of formulating questions

## Introduction

Before we get the right answer, we need to know how to ask the right question. The process of asking a question helps clarify not only the exact result we want to get but all of the information we have access to or adjacent questions we are responsible for. We can follow an established set of methods to determine what question we need to ask.

### Identify Effective Methods of Formulating Questions

* Standard Template for Questions
  * A reduced section of code (donâ€™t post the whole thing)
  * State your inputs (cut down for size, if necessary)
  * State your outputs
  * State your expectation
  * State your theory for what should have happened
  * Check the docs to make sure your implementation works like you think it did
  * Test the implementation in IRB
  * If necessary at this point, submit the question.
  * Generally: methodical description and documentation will help you see your bug

## Conclusion

If we follow a set of effective methods for formulating questions, we are generally able to either come up with the answers on our own or present a question that is targeted, informed and most likely to produce the result we need.
